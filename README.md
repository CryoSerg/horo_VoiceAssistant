# Horo Voice Assistant

![We are NOT limited by the technology of our time!](poster.jpg)

`Horo` - is a voice assistant made as an experiment using neural networks for things like **STT/TTS/Wake Word/NLU** etc.

The main project challenges we try to achieve is:
 - 100% offline *(no cloud)*
 - Open source *(full transparency)*
 - No data collection *(we respect your privacy)*

Our backend stack is ü¶Ä **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** with ‚ù§Ô∏è **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/)**.<br>
For the frontend we use ‚ö°Ô∏è **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** + üõ†Ô∏è **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**.

*Other libraries, tools and packages can be found in source code.*

## Neural Networks

This are the neural networks we are currently using:

 - Speech-To-Text
	 - [Vosk Speech Recognition Toolkit](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api) via [Vosk-rs](https://github.com/Bear-03/vosk-rs)
 - Text-To-Speech
	 - [~~Silero TTS~~](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~~Coqui TTS~~](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~~WinRT~~](https://github.com/ndarilek/tts-rs) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~gTTS~](https://github.com/nightlyistaken/tts_rust) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~~SAM~~](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM) *(currently not used)*
 - Wake Word
	 - [Rustpotter](https://github.com/GiviMAD/rustpotter) *(Partially implemented, still WIP)*
	 - [Picovoice Porcupine](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine) via [official SDK](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine#rust) *(requires API key)*
	 - [Vosk Speech Recognition Toolkit](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api) via [Vosk-rs](https://github.com/Bear-03/vosk-rs) *(very slow)*
	 - [~~Snowboy~~] *(currently not used)*
 - NLU
	 - Nothing yet.
- Chat
	- [~~ChatGPT~~](https://chat.openai.com/) (coming soon)

## Supported Languages

Currently, only Russian language is supported.<br>

## How to build?

Nothing special was used to build this project.<br>
You need only Rust and NodeJS installed on your system.<br>
Other than that, all you need is to install all the dependencies and then compile the code with `cargo tauri build` command.<br>
Or run dev with `cargo tauri dev`.

<br><br>
*Thought you might need some of the platform specific libraries for [PvRecorder](https://github.com/Picovoice/pvrecorder) and [Vosk](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api).*
